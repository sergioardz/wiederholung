            <p>Hey there! My name is Sergio Rodriguez and I'm from Monterrey Mexico. I am a technology-enthusiast and a web-app developer. My background as a continuous improvement agent in the international manufacturing industry enables me to create smart solutions suited for this and/or any other industries.</p>
            <p>I am all about creating value and eliminating waste in whichever endeavor I am dealing with at the time. As a Web Developer I want to leverage today’s tech advantages and transform data into information to help make better decisions. Let’s create better-suited solutions and continue to create value.</p>
            <p>I have a Master’s degree in Business Administration and a Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering. Native Spanish speaker and fluent on both English and German. Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, Quality Systems Audit and APQP are some of my acquired skills over the years, together with the recently acquired ones: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React, NodeJS, MySQL and MongoDB.</p>
            <p>My abilities of thinking strategically and being able to communicate well to technical and non-technical audiences equip me for a role as a Web Developer for the Manufacturing Industry.</p>
